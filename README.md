Brief Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of the Uber Fares Dataset.Leveraging Python for data preprocessing and Power BI for interactive visualizations, the study explores fare trends, season trends, among other significant contributors within urban transportation in order to gain deeper insights and make appropriate data driven decisions.

Tools & Techniques Utilized

1.Python 
-pandas as pd: Handled data manipulation and analysis.
-seaborn as sns: Handled statistical data visualization
-numpy as np: Handled numerical operations, especially arrays and mathematical functions.
-matplotlib.pyplot as plt: Utilized in plotting graphs, and charts
-from math import radians, sin, cos, sqrt, atan2: It was to provide math functions, particularly useful for   geographic distance calculations (like Haversine formula).
-import os: It was used to interact with the operating system, such as checking if files exist.
-import sys: It was utilized to access the system-specific parameters and functions.


2.Power BI
- Designed interactive dashboards with dynamic filtering features
- Created time-based visualizations to enhance data interpretation

3.Statistical Methods
- Conducted descriptive analytics for data profiling
- Detected outliers using quartile-based filtering techniques
 -Performed time-series segmentation to analyze ride trends over different period


Procedures

 -The dataset is extracted from Kaggle (uber.csv)
 -Then it is loaded into Python using the libraries mentioned above
 -Then EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) is performed on the dataset to describe variables and data types. 
  It is also used to generate descriptive statistics such as mean,mode, and so on. Then show relationship
  between key variables and highlights fare patterns 
 - Afterwards, the dataset is cleaned springing up (uber_cleaned.csv)
 -Then new features are added to the dataset to enhance its analytical capabilities
 -Subsequently (uber_enhanced.csv) is produced 
 -Afterwards, the enhanced dataset is imported in power bi
 -The power bi then designs interactive dashboard and visualisation for better comprehension and analysis of the dataset
- Then the entire process is summarized in a report that consists of the objective and main focus of the project,general overview of the conduction of the project, thorough insightful analysis, results alongside visualisations for clear and  accurate demonstration, and lastly deductions are made accompanied by data driven recommendations.
